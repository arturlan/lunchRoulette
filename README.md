# Foursquare Lunch Roulette

Calls the Foursquare API with a search term you specify to find somewhere near to The Cowley Road in Oxford to eat that kind of food.

Originally built for a White October hack day, because we can't decide where to have lunch! :)

## Set-up

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Run `npm install`
- [Create an app with the Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps) and paste the Client ID and Client Secret you get from that into the `config` object in [lunchroulette.js](lunchroulette.js)
- Run `node lunchroulette.js`
- Open your browser and go to [localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444)
